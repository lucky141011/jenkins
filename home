IMPROPERLY SLOPED 2ND FLOOR
Guttering was improperly sloped away from downspouts. Improperly sloped guttering can trap water in the gutter and cause the gutters to fill up and eventually overflow. The added weight of all the water trapped in the guttering can also cause guttering to detach from the house. I recommend having a professional evaluate and correct as needed.
SEALING GAPS
sealing gaps and or openings on and around the home where needed. Gaps or areas with missing/inadequate caulk/sealant can allow for moisture/insect intrusion which can lead to further damage and more costly repairs.
RECOMMEND CAULKING DOORS
I recommend caulking around exterior doors where needed. Gaps or areas with missing/inadequate caulk/sealant can allow for moisture/insect intrusion which can lead to further damage and more costly repairs
KICKOUT FLASHING MISSING
There was no kickout flashing present where the roof meets the house wall. Water can start wearing at the siding where the roof and the siding meet. Water may also be able to get behind the siding and cause damage. Kickout flashing reduces the potential for water intrusion. Kickout, also called diverter flashing, is required. I recommend having a professional evaluate and install kickout flashing
damaged shingles & holes from SCAFFOLDIN
The roof had areas of damaged shingles. There were holes in the roof from where the siders scaffolding was nailed/screwed off. The proper way to nail off scaffolding is to break the shingle seal, lift the shingle, nail off under the shingle tabs, then reseal the tabs down when finished. Having holes in the shingles and then putting sealant in them is a temporary fix as the sealant will deteriorate

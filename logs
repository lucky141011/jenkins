All Fusion API's in Perf environment will be down from 11/1/2023 7 AM EST. 
DBA team needs 7hrs approximately to complete the RAC conversion. 
I will perform API restart once RAC conversion are completed. 

Dear Team,

Please be informed that all Fusion APIs in the Perf environment will experience downtime starting from 11/1/2023 at 7 AM EST. The Database Administration (DBA) team estimates that approximately 7 hours will be required to complete the RAC conversion process.

Following the successful completion of the RAC conversion, I will initiate the restart of the APIs.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation during this essential maintenance.
